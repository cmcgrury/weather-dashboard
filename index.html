<!-- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to control the appearance of html elements, things such as fonts, colors, layout, spacing, animations, responsiveness.  A stylesheet is a file usually just named style.css that contains a bunch of CSS rules.
 This is linked by using the line "<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">" inside <head>.-->


<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Doctype is a declaration that tells the browser which version of HTML you're using, basically always just "html"-->
<html> <!-- The root of the document, wraps everything on webpage and tells the browser that everything in here is html code. Also requires two child elements, <head> and <body>-->
    <head> <!-- <head> is like the settings of the page, includes links to stylesheets(?), scripts, and metadata. Basically how the page behaves but isn't visible.-->
        <title>Chet's Weather App</title> <!-- <title> sets the name of the tab-->
    </head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- See first comment. Reminder: link is used for css, script is used for scripts. see next line.-->
    <body> <!-- Body is where what the user sees and interacts with goes-->
        <div class="center-container"> <!-- Try using a class, these are similar to IDs but they can be reused again and again for example #header.center_container, #text.center_container, etc.-->
            <img id="mainImage" src="weather.jpg" width="275" height="154">
        </div>
                <p id="instructions">Please enter the name of your city, state, and/or country divided by commas as shown in the input box.</p>
        <div id="utilityContainer">
            <input id="input" type="text" placeholder="e.g., Lincoln, NE, US">  
            <button id="getWeatherButton">Get my weather</button> <!-- creates button with id getWeatherButton-->
            <h1 id="location"></h1>
        </div>
        <div id="weatherResult"></div> <!-- <div> is like a box inside the web page where things inside this div box will be displayed.-->
        <script src="script.js"></script> <!-- Links the script file to the html file-->
    </body>
