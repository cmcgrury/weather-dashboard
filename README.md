# Chet's Weather App

This is a project I started to teach myself how to use APIs, as well as building webpages using HTML, JS, and CSS.

A simple web app that allows users to input a city name and displays:
- Weather Description
- Current Temperature
- Current Feels Like Temperature
- Wind Speed
- Sunrise Time
- Humidity
- Rain Volume (if applicable)
- Time Of Data Collection
- Forecast for weather conditions, rain precipitation chance, high/low temp, and max humidity

## How to use:
1. Enter a city name (for example, 'Lincoln', 'Lincoln, NE, US')
2. Click the 'Get my weather' button
3. Weather data will appear below

## Features to add:
- An option to see a future forecast (done)
- More error handling (done)
- Reformat the page to have two columns instead of 1, allowing for more data to be displayed (done)
- General asthetic improvements, more pictures, etc. (done)
- More to come...

## Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API
